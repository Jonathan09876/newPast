Rebuilding Legacy Applications
Do you have outdated software that is difficult to update and support? Developers are not able to make reasonable estimates and follow them. Every update causes a bunch of bugs afterward. No one really knows what's inside.
Based on our expertise, we can offer a step-by-step refactoring plan or a complete rebuild of your application from scratch. We have successful cases in our portfolio for both approaches.

Rescuing Your Product Development
In case your product is not complete or does not work, past developers disappeared with no documentation or code is messy and unmaintainable we can work on it to help you release a working product. We will restore your system after an unsuccessful development and build up a sustainable process for further development of the product.
Having accumulated experience in multiple IT systems, we know how to quickly join our clients’ projects and provide high-quality results on time.
